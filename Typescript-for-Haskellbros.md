# Introduction

It goes here!

# Things you should know

- C syntax
- mainstream OO
- simple lambda calculus, untyped and typed
- OR -
- Javascript

# Things that might be new

- Javascript primitive types
- structural typing
- gradual typing
- merging
- unit types

# Things that are like Haskell/ML

But different. Usually worse. 

- contextual typing
- untagged unions
- discriminated unions
- type aliases
- tagged [unit] types
- ad-hoc replacements for The Popular Monads
- modules

# Advanced types that are Javascript's fault

- Mapped types

You know what? This section is so tiring. Go read about these types on their own pages.

# Advanced types that are not in Typescript

- Higher-kinded types

So don't try to wrute any monads.
