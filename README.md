# Manuals

These aren't really manuals. They're more like opinionated notes that
I have taken while learning something. That means they're going to be
incomplete and incorrect most of the time.

You're probably most interested in the notes on
[Typescript compiler implementation](Typescript-compiler-implementation.md).
I should add matching notes on Typescript compiler design too, but I'm
not in the middle of that yet.

Notes:

 * [Typescript compiler implementation](Typescript-compiler-implementation.md)

Posts:

 * [Widening and Narrowing in Typescript](Widening-and-Narrowing-in-Typescript.md)
 * [Assignability](Assignability.md)
 * [Why ThisType?](Why-ThisType.md)
 * [Workarounds for Out of Memory Crashes](Workarounds-for-Out-of-Memory-Crashes.md)
 * [Checker reduction plan](Checker-reduction-plan.md)


 * [How to upgrade to Typescript without anybody noticing](How-to-upgrade-to-Typescript-without-anybody-noticing.md)
   Or, split into [part 1](How-to-upgrade-to-Typescript-without-anybody-noticing-part-1.md) and [part 2](How-to-upgrade-to-Typescript-without-anybody-noticing-part-2.md).
 * [Upgrade node library to Typescript](Upgrade-node-library-to-Typescript.md)
