# Manuals

These aren't really manuals. They're more like opinionated notes that
I have taken while learning something. That means they're going to be
incomplete and incorrect most of the time.

You're probably most interested in the notes on
[Typescript compiler implementation](Typescript-compiler-implementation.md).
I should add matching notes on Typescript compiler design too, but I'm
not in the middle of that yet.

Manuals:

 * [Typescript compiler implementation](Typescript-compiler-implementation.md)
 * [Checker reduction plan](Checker-reduction-plan.md)
