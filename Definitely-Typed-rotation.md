# What Definitely Not To Do To Definitely Typed To Do Well

## Basics

- Look at the project board.
  - Check and Merge
  - New Definitions
  - *Other*
- Look at PRs and merge them.
  - Make sure owners of existing packages have signed off.
  - Or review it yourself if they don't show up.
  - Same for new packages.
- Watch the gitter channel.
  - Contact Nathan about technical problems.
  - Ignore everything else unless you're bored.
- Watch the status badges on the front page.
  - Contact Nathan about failures.

## Philosophy

- You need to merge over 120 pull requests in one week.
  - A normal code review accounts for social and technical factors.
  - Social:
    - Do I trust the author?
    - Do I trust the author's technical ability?
    - Do I believe the behaviour change is a good idea?
  - Technical:
    - Are there bugs?
    - Is the code efficient?
    - Does the code implement the desired behaviour?
  - You do not have (1) time or (2) knowledge to do these things for Definitely Typed.
  - Don't even try.
- Discursion on ethics
  - Try to minimise harm.
  - Treat Popular differently from unpopular.
- Delegate to community
  - Do I trust the author? YES

## Tips

- Use unpkg to look at shipped code.
- Use npmjs to determine popularity.
- Use project filters to do oldest first.
